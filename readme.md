Just a simple demo of a few technologies mixed up together...

* Websockets for both javascript and Tornado (Python)
* Filereader API for javascript
* Camera / Fileuploader for mobile (only *android*... for now..)

### what does it do?
>The basic idea is to take a picture with a mobile phone (android for now) and it will instantly be uploaded to a web browser for other people to watch without long polling and other annoying "old school" methods. This app is short and light, just the way it should be. :)

### how to install?
> 1.  [get tornado, it's awesome!](http://www.tornadoweb.org/)
 2. clone this awesome repo
3. open up porn 8889 or change the port from the run_me.py
4. cd to folder and python run_me.py

### how to use?
>* on your phone.. browse to the  your_url/phone
>* on your browser.. browse to the your_url/browser
* take a picture on the phone.. and watch it instantly get uploaded to the browser..

### Any restrictions on the code?
